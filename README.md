# Eleven Labs Infrastructure for n8n

## Overview

This codebase represents a powerful integration between ElevenLabs' AI voice generation capabilities and the n8n workflow automation platform. This fusion creates a versatile infrastructure for building sophisticated AI voice pipelines with minimal coding.

## Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture built on Docker with two main components:

- **n8n Workflow Engine**: Orchestrates data flow and business logic
- **ElevenLabs Custom Node**: Provides seamless access to state-of-the-art voice AI capabilities

## Core Capabilities

The integration unlocks several advanced AI voice manipulation features:

- **Text-to-Speech**: Generate natural-sounding voice from text with fine-grained control
- **Voice Cloning**: Create digital voices that sound like specific individuals
- **Voice Transformation**: Convert speech from one voice to another
- **Audio Isolation**: Remove background noise from recordings
- **Speech-to-Text**: Transcribe audio with high accuracy
- **Sound Effect Generation**: Create realistic sound effects from text descriptions

## Engineering Philosophy

This infrastructure embodies several principles that elite AI engineers value:

1. **Composable Architecture**: Each AI function is modularized, allowing for flexible combinations in complex workflows
2. **API-First Design**: Clean interfaces that abstract complexity while preserving flexibility
3. **Containerized Deployment**: Consistent environment across development and production
4. **Configuration as Code**: Infrastructure defined through Docker Compose and node definitions

## Implementation Notes

The codebase demonstrates sophisticated implementation patterns:

- Type-safe coding with TypeScript for robust development
- Declarative API configuration via routing objects
- Streaming-friendly binary data handling
- Flexible parameter validation and transformation

## Getting Started

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the n8n instance with ElevenLabs integration
4. Access n8n at http://localhost:5678
5. Set up your ElevenLabs API credentials in n8n

## Production Considerations

When deploying to production:
- Secure your API keys using environment variables
- Consider network security for API access
- Implement proper error handling for AI model limitations
- Plan for scalability based on concurrent processing needs

## Contributing

This project follows a modern infrastructure-as-code approach, making it easy to extend with additional AI capabilities as ElevenLabs expands their service offerings.
